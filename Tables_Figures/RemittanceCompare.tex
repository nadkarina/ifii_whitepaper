The SOFIA data are representative of adults 17 years and older living in East Java, West Nusa Tenggara, East Nusa Tenggara and South Sulawesi. FII data has been subset accordingly. Remittance use is captured by a series of questions in the FII including receipt of remittances in the past year, use of ATM cards for remittances, and the use of the post office for remittances. In SOFIA, respondents are asked if they sent or received money in the past year. \end{tablenotes} \end{threeparttable} \end{adjustbox} \end{table} \vspace*{-5mm}
